/*Add a class to the previous exercise that represents a collection of contacts, both of the base
 class and the derived class. The collection class should include a single method to add a contact,
  regardless of class, to the collection - this demonstrates upcasting. The collection class should also
   include a method to iterate through the contacts and call their display methods - this demonstrates late
    binding.
